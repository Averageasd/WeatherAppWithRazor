# Weather app with Razor and .NET

## About
a simple application where Razor was used to render hard-coded weather
data. I learnt syntax of Razor and how to display single items
as well as list of items. Noted: The goal of building this
application was to learn how to set up views folder and work with
Razor. Therefore, the pages looked very plain as not much CSS
was applied for decoration purposes.
